# Authentication

sidekick supports four auth methods, set by `auth.method` in
`~/.config/sidekick/config.json` (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)):

| Method | Backend | Needs a GCP project | Web access (`web=true`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `adc` (default) | Vertex AI | yes | not available |
| `env` | Vertex AI | yes | not available |
| `keychain` (macOS) | Vertex AI | yes | not available |
| `api_key` | Gemini Developer API (Google AI Studio) | no | available |

The three Vertex methods only differ in where the credentials come from; they share the same
models, `project`/`location` settings and IAM role (`roles/aiplatform.user`). **Web access needs
`api_key`**: on Vertex the bridge drops `web=true`, answers without the web and says so in a
`[sidekick notice]` (the Gemini API flag that lets web tools share a request with the
bridge's file tools is Developer-API only).

Credentials are loaded once, at server startup. A failure stops the server and is written to the
log (see [logging.md](logging.md)) with the fix; the messages are listed in
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

**Setting up auth.** Install the plugin (`/plugin install sidekick@sidekick`), then run
`/sidekick:setup` and pick a method — it writes `auth` in `config.json` for you. The one manual
step it can't do for `api_key`: the key itself must be an environment variable in the shell that
starts Claude Code (see [Method 4](#method-4-api-key-google-ai-studio) below), because the
plugin's MCP server inherits Claude Code's environment directly, with no registration step to
inject it.

## The critical distinction: `gcloud auth login` vs ADC

These are **separate credential stores** and **separate re-auth timelines**:

| Command | Authenticates | Stored at | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gcloud auth login` | gcloud CLI only | `~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db` | Short-lived; org session-timeout policy |
| `gcloud auth application-default login` | SDKs and APIs | `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` | Refresh token; typically months |

With `auth.method = "adc"` the MCP server uses **ADC only**. When your gcloud CLI session
expires and you re-auth with `gcloud auth login`, the MCP server is **unaffected**. You only need to re-run
`gcloud auth application-default login` if ADC itself expires (rare on a personal machine).

**Verify ADC is working:**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
```
If this returns a token, the MCP server will authenticate successfully.

---

## Method 1: ADC (Default, Recommended)

**One-time setup:**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

The first command opens a browser and stores a refresh token at
`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`. The SDK auto-refreshes access tokens
from this refresh token — no repeated re-auth.

The second command is required when using **user credentials** (as opposed to a service account).
User credentials span all your GCP projects, so the Vertex AI API needs to know which project's
quota to charge. Without it you will receive a `403 PERMISSION_DENIED: quota project not set`
error when calling the API. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) table for the fix if you
already have ADC set up.

**Run `/sidekick:setup` and choose `adc`.** It checks
`gcloud auth application-default print-access-token` and stops if ADC is not configured.

**Config:**
```json
{"project": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", "auth": {"method": "adc"}}
```

**Minimum GCP permissions:** `roles/aiplatform.user` on the project.

---

## Method 2: Env File SA

Use a service account key file on disk. Set the environment variable **before starting Claude Code** — the server reads it at startup:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/sa-key.json
```

The server reads `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` itself and loads that file explicitly. It
never falls back to your ADC user credentials: an unset variable or a missing file stops
startup with a message naming the problem (#86), so this method can no longer run the server
as you instead of the service account. The plugin's MCP server inherits Claude Code's
environment directly, so export the variable in the shell **profile** of the shell that starts
Claude Code (e.g. `~/.zshrc`) — a one-off `export` in the current shell won't reach a
subsequent Claude Code launch.

**Setup steps:**
1. Create or download a service account key in GCP IAM → Service Accounts → Keys
2. Grant the SA `roles/aiplatform.user` on your project
3. Store the JSON file in a secure location (e.g. `~/.config/sidekick/sa-key.json`, mode 600)
4. Export the env var in your shell profile
5. Run `/sidekick:setup` and choose `env`

**Auth block written by `/sidekick:setup`** (alongside `project` and `location`):
```json
{"auth": {"method": "env"}}
```

`/sidekick:setup` checks the env var in its own shell. If it is set but the file does not exist,
setup stops with an error. If it is not set, it warns but continues — you can set it later before
starting Claude Code.

**Caution:** The key file persists on disk. Use only on full-disk-encrypted machines with restricted file permissions (`chmod 600`).

---

## Method 3: Apple Keychain (macOS only)

Store the service account JSON in Apple Keychain. The server reads it once at startup into memory — the raw JSON is never written to disk after the initial store, and disappears when the process exits.

**Why Keychain over a disk file:** A SA JSON on disk is a persistent secret at rest. Keychain provides OS-managed storage with ACL enforcement. This is the preferred service account path for DLP-sensitive environments.

**One-time setup — store the SA JSON:**
```bash
security add-generic-password \
  -s "sidekick" \
  -a "vertex-sa" \
  -w "$(cat /path/to/sa-key.json)"
rm /path/to/sa-key.json   # remove disk copy immediately
```

**Run `/sidekick:setup` and choose `keychain`.** It prompts for the service and account names, then verifies the item exists and contains valid JSON before writing config.

**Auth block written by `/sidekick:setup`** (alongside `project` and `location`):
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "method": "keychain",
    "keychain_service": "sidekick",
    "keychain_account": "vertex-sa"
  }
}
```

**Minimum SA role:** `roles/aiplatform.user` (Vertex AI User) on the project. It covers the
`generateContent` calls and the model listing the bridge does at startup. It grants more than
prediction, so if you need tighter scope, build a custom role and test it with
`list_models` and one `ask` call.

The server reads the item with `security find-generic-password -s <service> -a <account> -w`.
macOS returns a multi-line value (like SA JSON) as a hex string; the server detects and decodes
that before parsing.

macOS only. The `security` CLI is not available on Linux, and `/sidekick:setup` doesn't offer `keychain` there.

## Method 4: API Key (Google AI Studio)

The simplest path — no GCP project, no `gcloud` setup, no service account. Get a key from
[aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and set an environment variable.

**One-time setup:** export the key in the shell **profile** of the shell that starts Claude Code
(e.g. `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) — the plugin's MCP server inherits Claude Code's environment
directly, so the key must already be set before Claude Code launches:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
```
A one-off `export` in your current terminal, without adding it to the profile, will not survive
the next time you start Claude Code. Claude Code launched from a GUI/desktop app icon (rather
than a terminal) may not inherit shell-profile exports at all — launch it from a terminal in
that case.

**Or keep the key in the macOS Keychain** instead of the profile, and read it only when you
launch. Store it once (`-w` with no value prompts for it, so it never lands in shell history):
```bash
security add-generic-password -s sidekick-api-key -a "$USER" -w
```
Then add a named launch alias to your profile and start Claude Code with it:
```bash
# Claude Code with the sidekick plugin's Gemini API key (from macOS Keychain)
alias cc-sidekick-mcp='GEMINI_API_KEY="$(security find-generic-password -s sidekick-api-key -a "$USER" -w)" command claude'
```
The key is set only for that `claude` process and its children, not in every shell.

**Run `/sidekick:setup` and choose `api_key`.** It asks for the **name** of the env var (default:
`GEMINI_API_KEY`), re-prompts if what you typed looks like a key instead of a name (starts with
`AIza`, contains lowercase letters, or is over 40 characters), and warns if the variable is not
set in its own shell. The server applies the same check at startup and refuses to start if
`api_key_env` looks like a key.

**Config written by `/sidekick:setup`:**
```json
{
  "default_thinking": "medium",
  "transcript_dir": "./session-summaries",
  "auth": {
    "method": "api_key",
    "api_key_env": "GEMINI_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

`project` and `location` are omitted — they are not required by the Google AI Studio
(Developer API) endpoint. `default_model` is added only if you entered one.

**Positioning:**
- Use this method for personal use, quick setup, or when you don't have a GCP project
- ADC and Keychain methods remain first-class for team/enterprise use — they support larger
  quota tiers, org-managed access control, and service account rotation
- The API key is read from the env var at server startup and held in memory; it is never
  written to `config.json`
- This is the only method with web access (`web=true`, `web_tools.enabled`); see
  [tools.md](tools.md#web-access)

**Quota:** AI Studio rate limits depend on the model and on whether billing is enabled for the
key; check the current limits in AI Studio. Limits are generally lower than Vertex AI. When a
model is overloaded or out of quota (503/429), the bridge retries with backoff and then falls back
once to the newest Flash-Lite (see [configuration.md](configuration.md#choosing-a-model)).

| `'api_key_env' in config.json contains what looks like an API key` | The key itself was put in `api_key_env` | Set `api_key_env` to the variable name, e.g. `"GEMINI_API_KEY"` |
| `'project' is required for Vertex AI auth methods` | `project` missing with `adc`/`env`/`keychain` | Add `project` to config.json, or switch to `api_key` |
