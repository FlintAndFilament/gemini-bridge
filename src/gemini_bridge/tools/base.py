"""
gemini_bridge/tools/base.py
----------------------------
Shared type definitions and helper for all MCP tools.

Responsibilities:
  - Define ToolResult type alias (return type for all tool handlers)
  - Define ThinkingParam type alias (optional thinking level parameter)
  - Provide call_gemini() helper that combines ask() + transcript append
  - Give Gemini the file tools matching the calling tool's capability row (read / read+write)
  - Describe that capability row back to the MCP client (capability_hint, tool_annotations)
  - Save the final answer as an artifact when the calling tool asks for one

Design notes:
  - Interface Segregation: tools import only what they need from here; no server/config exposure
  - Single Responsibility: shared plumbing only — no tool-specific logic lives here
  - Liskov Substitution: all tools return ToolResult; callers are agnostic to which tool ran

Raises:
  (none directly) — call_gemini() surfaces ClientError messages as ToolResult strings

Imports:  client.py (GeminiClient), transcript.py (TranscriptWriter), config.py (ThinkingLevel),
