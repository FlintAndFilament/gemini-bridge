gemini_bridge/guide.py
------------------------
What the calling Claude session is told about this server: the short instructions sent on
connect, and the full detail gemini_help returns on demand.

Responsibilities:
  - Build the server instructions within the client's size cap (#78)
  - Build the gemini_help topics: tools, files, web, sessions, disk, and one per tool
  - Derive every row from what enforces it (#74) — the capability set exported by the tool
    modules, the live deny-list, the walk-skip set, the workspace's write cap, and the
    backend's web support — so the advertised surface cannot drift from the wired one

Design notes:
  - Claude Code keeps only about the first 2048 characters of a server's instructions and
    drops the rest without telling anyone. The instructions are therefore an overview that
    fits INSTRUCTIONS_BUDGET in every config variant; anything longer lives in help_text()
  - Single Responsibility: text only; no registration, no config loading

Used by:  server.py (instructions + gemini_help wiring)
Imports:  tools/ (capabilities and hints), file_tools.py, sandbox.py, web_tools.py,
          workspace.py, transcript.py
