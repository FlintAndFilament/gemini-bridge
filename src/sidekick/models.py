"""
sidekick/models.py
-----------------------
Single source of truth for backend-aware model discoverability.

Responsibilities:
  - Define the curated, recommended model shortlist per backend
  - Detect the active backend from the auth method
  - Build the schema-hint string injected into every tool's `model` param
  - Filter a live models.list() down to chat-capable models
  - Resolve "latest" per family (flash / flash-lite / pro) from a live catalog, and map the
    bridge's short aliases and Google's '-latest' aliases to a family

Design notes:
  - Single Responsibility: pure data + small pure functions; no SDK, no network, no I/O
  - Dependency Inversion: depends on nothing else in the package (avoids a circular import
    with client.py, which owns DEFAULT_MODEL/FALLBACK_MODEL). Consumers that need both a
    model constant AND these helpers import each from its own module.
  - Open/Closed: adding a model means editing RECOMMENDED here and nowhere else — the docs
    went stale precisely because there was no single source.

Curated ids verified live 2026-07-08:
  - Developer API `-latest` aliases (gemini-flash-latest, gemini-pro-latest) confirmed present.
  - Vertex GA text models confirmed against Google Cloud model docs; gemini-3.5-flash is GA.
    Vertex has NO `-latest` aliases (they 404), so its shortlist is alias-free.
