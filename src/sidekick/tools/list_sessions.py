------------------------------------
MCP tool: list_sessions — the conversations this server holds in memory right now (#15).

Responsibilities:
  - Register the list_sessions MCP tool
  - Render each live session as tool, session_name, model and committed turns

Design notes:
  - Single Responsibility: formatting only; the session cache and its LRU order live in
    client.py, read through GeminiClient.sessions()
  - No API call, no transcript, no artifact: it reads process memory and writes nothing
  - There is no new_session tool: a new session_name already starts a fresh conversation,
    and every generating tool's session_name description says so

Used by:  tools/__init__.py -> register_list_sessions(), server.py
Imports:  client.py (GeminiClient, Session, MAX_SESSIONS), tools/base.py (ToolResult)
