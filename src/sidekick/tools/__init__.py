"""
sidekick/tools/__init__.py
---------------------------------
Tool package root — re-exports all MCP tool registration callables.

Responsibilities:
  - Collect tool modules into a single importable namespace
  - Collect the generating tools' capability rows so server.py can advertise them (#74)

Design notes:
  - Open/Closed: new tools add a module here + one import line — server.py unchanged

Used by:  server.py (registers all tools)
Imports:  tools/ask.py, tools/brainstorm.py, tools/review.py, tools/debug.py, tools/architect.py,
          tools/list_models.py, tools/help.py
